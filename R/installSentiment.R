## Note: sentimente package has been deprecated. Therefore, manual install is needed. There doesn't seem to be a good alternative to it (but my research wasn't extensive)

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
install.packages("Rstem_0.4-1.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
install.packages("sentiment_0.2.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
